				Created this custom solution as a freelancing project, It optimizes the
				monitoring and health checks of remote systems in a Linux environment. By
				combining the power of the python and bash scripting languages with the
				paramiko and prettytable libraries, this script establishes an SSH
				connection to gather in-depth information about the virtual machine
				instances on a host. This includes crucial details like NUMA node CPU
				configurations, active VMs, and cores utilized by each VM. The processed and
				stored data provides valuable insights, making this script a highly
				effective tool in ensuring the health of remote systems.

				Tabularize is a Python library for generating simple tables. It was inspired
				by the PrettyTable library in python. We can control many aspects of a
				table, such as the width of the column padding, the alignment of text, or
				the table border. It's a trimmed-down version of PrettyTable with even
				simpler implementation and lightness in terms of library resources.
