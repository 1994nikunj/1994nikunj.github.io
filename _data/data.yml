    title: About me
    summary: |
      I want to be a part of something meaningful, where organizational success is aligned to individual growth 
      and achievements is measured in terms of positive outcomes. Furthermore, growth should never be achieved at 
      the price of environmental. social or personal upheaval.
      
      Technology isn't just a tool, it's an experience, and the thing about experience is that you can 
      go as far as your imagination takes you.
      
      So, now, in industry and in college, this passion remains with me. There's undoubtedly more to learn, 
      more problems to solve, and yet more to create. And for this, I am quite excited and grateful.
      Feel free to contact me; I'm open for conversations, collaborations, programming guidance, 
      technological support, and others.
